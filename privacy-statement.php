<p>We are the data processors and not the data controllers of the information on our platform for purposes of the EU Directive on Data Protection (Directive) and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection. Our EEA or Switzerland based customers, who control their customer data and send it to PayeCRM for processing, are the “controllers” of that data and are responsible for compliance with the Directive. In particular, PayeCRM’s customers are responsible for complying with the Directive and relevant data protection legislation in the relevant EEA member state before sending personal information to PayeCRM for processing. We work with our customers to help them provide notice to their customers concerning the purpose for which personal information is collected.</p>
